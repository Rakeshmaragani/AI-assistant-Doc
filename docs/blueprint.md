# **App Name**: Document Sage

## Core Features:

- Document Upload: Users can upload documents in PDF or TXT format through a clean and intuitive interface.
- Auto Summary: Uses GenAI to provide a concise summary of the uploaded document, limited to 150 words. Summarization feature makes use of a tool to determine if parts of the summary can be excluded or shortened based on their complexity, given the word limit.
- Interaction Modes: Offers two modes of interaction: 'Ask Anything' for free-form questions and 'Challenge Me' for logic-based questions.
- Ask Anything: In 'Ask Anything' mode, users can ask questions based on the document, with the assistant answering using contextual understanding and providing justifications with references to the document.
- Challenge Me: In 'Challenge Me' mode, the system generates three logic-based questions derived from the document. The assistant evaluates each response and provides feedback with justification based on the document. AI evaluates the answer in comparison to reference snippets to ensure the validity of the answers given.
- Answer Highlighting: Highlights the specific snippet from the source document that supports each answer for better clarity and verification.
